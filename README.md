## What is this?

A 16 Step MIDI Sequencer for the browser built in React with the [WebMidi.js API](https://webmidijs.org/docs/)

## Why build this?

After years of being dissatisfied with the built-in "piano roll" sequencer of Ableton Live, I'd been craving a simple step-sequencer UI, similar to hardware drum machines I've owned in the past

## How to use:

1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm run start`
3. Select one of your machine's current MIDI ports (if on Mac and none available, refer to the [Audio MIDI Setup User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/audio-midi-setup/set-up-midi-devices-ams875bae1e0/mac)

## Is this app currently deployed?

Yes! It's served with Firebase [here](https://react-midi-sequencer.web.app/)

## Can I just see a demo?

[Sure thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XniKvlTvUpo)
